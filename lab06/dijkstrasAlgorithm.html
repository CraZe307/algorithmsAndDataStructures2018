    // at some point within building this I broke the dist part
    // after creating the while loop running over current the dist
    // stopped updating from infinity to the value given.
    // So dist just stays at infinity for everything.
    // I think it is a problem with my if statement somewhere or perhaps how I am getting the weight
    // I ran out of time to complete the assignment or I would have looked into this more.

    // initialize the dist to infinity and the source to 0
    // while there are unmarked vertices
